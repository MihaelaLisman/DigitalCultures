		<p>In the digital environment, where physical interaction is missing, the aesthetic factor is very important. In this post I want to analyse the impact of the <q> food porn phenomenon</q> in the digital domain and, most important, on the viewers. 

Like all the other industries, the food industry was also impacted by the digital evolution. The old recipes books

became cooking blogs and social media accounts about cooking. Nowadays, very popular on every social media platform are fast cooking videos. Content creators are rapidly adapting to the high requested food related trends. <img src=""></p>
		
		<p><a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html#gsc.tab=0">Eating is the basic necessity for the human being</a>, individuals need food to survive. This is theorised by the psychologist Abraham Maslow who placed food at the bottom of his pyramid scheme of needs for human beings. (fig. 1). </p><img src=”https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow-5.jpg?ezimgfmt=rs:688x512/rscb24/ng:webp/ngcb24" alt=”fig.1 Maslow’s hierarchy of needs” width=”500px”>This explains why food is everywhere.


		<p>Food industry had an amazing break-through in the digital media creating its own niche – <b>food media</b> – where restaurants, chefs, amateur chefs or people interested in food related content started posting different pictures and videos to showcase their work.</p>
		


		<h3>Short background</h3>
		<p>In 1957 Roland Barthes writes in his book, <cite><a href=”http://degustibus.pbworks.com/f/Barthes.pdf”> Mythologies </a></cite>, about food psychology. He didn’t use the expression <q>food porn</q>, but he commented that the effect of the food images is to induce the viewer into a visually pleasing fantasy because most of them cannot afford to cook the type of meals that are portrayed in the photos.</p>
		<p>The expression was firstly used in 1979 when Michael Jacobson compered healthy and unhealthy food. He used the term <q><a href=”https://cspinet.org/sites/default/files/attachment/back_cover_-_right_stuff___food_porn.pdf”> Food Porn </a></q> in an article in the <cite>Nutrition Action Healthletter</cite> newsletter to describe the type of food that is unhealthy for the human organism.</p>


		<h3><q>The after teste</q></h3>
		<p>The stylisation of food became a technique to give people more pleasure. This also explains the use of the term <p>porn</q>, because this phenomenon transformed the primary necessity into a visually pleasing proces.</p> The phenomenon induces the viewer into an unattainable state because he will not be able to match the cooking techniques he watches, thus the result will never be the same as in the video or image presented. This can be seen as a form of entertaining because people enjoy watching things that seem impossible or out of reach for them, secretly wanting to be able to perform accordingly.

		<p><q><a href=” https://reallifemag.com/eat-the-document/”>Food media stimulates an appetite that gives pleasure through being insatiable.</q></a></p>


<p> The phenomenon encouraged consumerism, because people tried various recipes viewed on social media. A recent example for this is the viral recipe of pasta with baked feta cheese and tomatoes. 
Quickly, Food Porn became a marketing scheme for businesses in food industry domain to sell their products.</p> 

<p> The phenomenon objectifies food, giving the idea that food as an object is worth basing at.... Here come the food gaze concept. Shared consumption of food through the online engagement
